"""Functions related to the E-NAUTILUS method are defined here.

Reference of the method:

Ruiz, A. B., Sindhya, K., Miettinen, K., Ruiz, F., & Luque, M. (2015).
E-NAUTILUS: A decision support system for complex multiobjective optimization
problems based on the NAUTILUS method. European Journal of Operational Research,
246(1), 218-231.

Variables:
- N_I: number of iterations to be carried out.
- N_S: number of points to investigate at each iteration.
- h: current iteration number.
- it_h: the number of iterations left at each iteration (including h)
- z_h: the selecte point by the DM at iteration h.
- P_h: the subset of reachable solutions at iteration h which can be reached
    from the previous iteration (h-1) without impairing any of the objective
    function values.
