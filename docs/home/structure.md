# The structure of DESDEO

In the big picture, DESDEO is not just a collection of interactive
multiobjective optimization methods, but a __full stack__ solution (which can be
run as an application)to provide decision-support for decision makers to tackle
real-life multiobjective optimization problems by utilizing interactive methods.
Being a full stack solution, it consists of three main components:

1. __the core-logic__,
2. __the web-API__, and
3. __the web-GUI__.

We will describe each of these components in the following sections.

## The core-logic

## The web-API
