Cells containing code found in the article will be marked accordingly (by a comment on the first line). The code shown may vary from the one in the article due to new additions and/or changes in the DESDEO framework. This is to ensure that the code shown can be run and experimented with in the future as well.\n",

We will consider a multiobjective optimization problem with five objectives and two variables. The problem will be treated both as an analytical problem and a data-based problem. We will show how the problem can be solved utilizing MCDM and EMO methods both separately and in tandem (hybridizing them). **Note:** Link to article with additional information to be added later."

    "We will assume that the same river pollution problem defined earlier is now computationally _very_ expensive. Thus, we will not try to evaluate the problem itself during optimization. Instead, we have pre-computed a small number (100) of solutions consisting of decision variable and objective values. We can then use these points to train a surrogate model which is computationally less expensive to evaluate and can therefore be readily used in an interactive method. We assume to have already computed the points mentioned earlier and that they are stored in a file `River_Pollution.csv` in a CSV format. The first two columns will consist of the decision variable values and the last five columns will consists of the objective values. We can use this data and together with _desdeo-problem_ and pandas to formulate a data-based problem in DESDEO:"
