    "to the ones from a previous implementation.\n",
    "This argument is therefore only relevant in testing the formulation and defaults to False.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the problem implementation, the decision variables are defined as vectors $\\mathbf{X}_i$, where $i$ is the number of\n",
    "unique units in the holding in question, and the number of elements in each decision variable represents the\n",
    "number of unique management schedules in the holding.\n",
    "Each element in the decision variables is a binary, that can only have the values 0 or 1.\n",
    "As only one plan is ultimately chosen for each unit, only one element can have value 1 in each decision variable.\n",
    "A decision variable could look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`X_4 = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`,\n",
    "\n",
    "where the fourth management plan would be executed for the unit with index 4.\n",
